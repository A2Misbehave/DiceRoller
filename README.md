### Digital Dice Roller for Table Top Games

A digital desktop dice roller for table top games, with builtin preset dice as well stats, history of rolls as well as profiles for keeping track of different sessions and characters and other information based on the game being played. Feature set subject to change based on initial build and how I'd like for it to look and or be built, not to mention my own skillset. 

Keep in mind, this is a practice project for me to get better using Python and building desktop applications, however, there is always the hope that it becomes something.
